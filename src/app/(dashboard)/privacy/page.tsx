            The safeguarding of your personal data and privacy is a top priority
            for us. To ensure full adherence to data protection regulations,
            including the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the
            Data Protection Act 2018 â€“ Chapter 586 of the Laws of Malta (and any
            relevant regulations), as well as the Privacy and Electronic
            Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 (as amended), we have
            implemented a privacy policy alongside our Terms of Use. This policy
            details how we collect and handle the personal information you
            provide to us. Our goal is to make this policy as clear and
            straightforward as possible, while also informing you about your
            legal rights concerning your personal data, which are explained in a
            later section.

            Processing of content - No profiling at personal level
          </h2>
          <p>
            Apolloscan searches content such as news and videos and evaluates
            them on the basis of extensive research using interfaces such as
            Google to obtain information. However, no personal profiles are
            created, only the content itself (text, video) is analyzed for
            accuracy or misinformation and given a corresponding score. This
            score provides information about the current level of
            trustworthiness of the information checked. The score relates
            exclusively to the content examined and has no legal or similarly
            significant effects on individual persons.
